Stress is a significant concern affecting mental and physical well-being, leading to adverse outcomes such as anxiety, depression, and reduced productivity. Existing research has explored physiological indicators such as heart rate variability, behavioural patterns, and digital interactions to detect and predict stress. While machine learning models, including deep learning and LSTMs, have shown promise in stress
classification, they often fail to integrate crucial lifestyle factors such as sleep patterns and social media activity. Our research aims to bridge this gap by developing a multimodal framework
that combines physiological, behavioural, and lifestyle data to provide more accurate stress prediction. We employ machine learning techniques such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decision Trees, and Random Forests, leveraging their effectiveness in classification tasks. Additionally, SHAP is used for model interpretability, ensuring transparency and personalized intervention strategies for better mental well-being.
